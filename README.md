## Questions?

If you have any questions or any ideas you want to share or need some insight to how you should be thinking about the design of the services don't hesitate to reachout! We'd rather you look for clarity on something that isn't clear or doesnt' make sense then waste your precious time on trying figure out something that would take someone else 5-10 mins to clear up for you.
